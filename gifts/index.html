<p id="intro"><strong>We will not be having the standard wedding list</strong>. We will be asking that if you want to make a donation towards a new sofa, new mattress or a new telly, then <a href="http://www.johnlewis.com/Shopping/giftvouchers.aspx">John Lewis gift vouchers</a> or plain old cash in an envelope would be splendid. We will provide a receptacle on the day.</p>
